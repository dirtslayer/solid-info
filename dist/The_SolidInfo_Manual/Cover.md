<!-- 
    While using HTML inside a md file, the rewrite-url behavior of markedjs is off. 
    
    As a result, paths need to be relative to root (see img above as an example)
    
    HTML allows us to use css to center, scale, and decorate stuff.

    Also, the page is an A4 page with a height:30cm, the preview is scaled.
